Software reference documentation
--------------------------------
The documentation for the classes, its members and methods is generated by Doxygen.
Doxygen is a documentation generator, a tool for writing software reference documentation. The documentation is written within code, and is thus relatively easy to keep up to date. Doxygen can cross reference documentation and code, so that the reader of a document can easily refer to the actual code.

### How to generate documentation
In the source tree a configuration file `Doxyfile` is provided. This file is condigured for this project and shouldn't need to change. However, feel free to change configuration to personal preferences. In order to generate documentation make sure the following tools are installed and added to the `PATH` environment variable. Both tools are available for Windows and Linux.

* Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org)
* Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org)

Once installed go to the root directory of the project and excecute the following command:
```shell
doxygen Doxyfile
```
Now a directory `doc` should be created (if not existing yet), and the reference documentation is located in there.
If one continues to work on this project, it is advised to update and create documentation in the style found elsewhere in the project. In this way the reference documenation is always complete and up to date.
